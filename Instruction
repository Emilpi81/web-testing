In your code, the Python threading library is used to perform concurrent operations.
This can increase the efficiency of your program when you have tasks that can be done independently of each other,
such as logging in different users and performing certain tests. Here's how multithreading works in your code:

The function run_tests_for_user is designed to perform all the operations for a single user: logging them in,
getting their access token, and running all the tests for that user.
The run_tests function is where the threading happens.
It starts by preparing some shared resources: the CSV writer and the access tokens for all the users.
It also creates an empty list, threads, to keep track of all the threads it will create.
Then it opens the file of user credentials and starts reading it row by row.
Each row contains the credentials for one user.
For each user, it creates a new thread using threading.Thread.
The target of this thread — the function that will be run in the new thread — is run_tests_for_user, and the arguments are the row of credentials and the CSV writer.
It starts the new thread with t.start(), adds it to the threads list, and then waits for a certain amount of time before continuing to the next row.
The effect of this is that all the users' tests are started in rapid succession, but not exactly at the same time.
There is a delay of Between_threads seconds between each one.
Once all the threads are started, the main thread — the one running run_tests — waits for all of them to finish using thread.
join(). This ensures that it doesn't proceed to the next step until all the tests are completed.
After all the threads have finished, it goes through all the web driver instances and closes them.
This way, the tests for all users are run in parallel, but with a controlled delay between each user's tests.
 This can be a lot faster than running them one at a time, and it can simulate the kind of load that a real system might experience with multiple users.
 It also makes sure that all the tests are completed before the program finishes
